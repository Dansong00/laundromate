### 🎨 Session Documentation Rule

**File**: `.cursor/rules/session-documentation.mdc`

**Purpose**: Automatically create session summary files when the user types `/document`

**Features**:
- ✅ **Automatic Timestamping**: Generates files with `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM` format
- ✅ **Structured Content**: Follows consistent markdown template
- ✅ **Session Analysis**: Reviews chat history for key decisions and implementations
- ✅ **Staged Changes**: Summarizes git staged changes when available
- ✅ **Integration**: Works with existing project structure

## 🚀 How to Use

### Command: `/document`

When you type `/document` in the chat, the AI will:

1. **Generate a timestamp** (e.g., `2025-01-15-1435`)
2. **Create a new file** in `development-logs/` directory
3. **Analyze the session** for key decisions, implementations, and challenges
4. **Check for staged changes** in git repository
5. **Write a comprehensive summary** following the template
6. **Confirm creation** with file location and brief summary

### Example Output

**User Input**: `/document`

**AI Response**:
```
✅ Session documentation created successfully!

📄 File: `development-logs/2025-01-15-1435-session-summary.md`
